"""
Abstract interface for zero-knowledge proof systems.

Groth16 (via circom + snarkjs, wrapped as a subprocess) is the first
implementation. Kept as its own interface — separate from CipherSuite
and HomomorphicAggregator — since "prove a statement about hidden data
without revealing it" is a distinct job from encryption or homomorphic
computation, even though all three compose together in EveFL's pipeline.
