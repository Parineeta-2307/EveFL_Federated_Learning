EveFL Streamlit Dashboard — Main Entry Point.

Phase 5: Visualization and interactive demos.

Navigation:
    - LIVE: BB84 / QBER Explorer
    - LIVE: 3-State Security Controller
    - LIVE: Crypto Pipeline Demo (AES-GCM real, CKKS/Groth16 STUB)
    - STATIC: FL Results (reads results/fl_training_log.json)

The FL Results panel does NOT run training.
It only reads the JSON exported by the Kaggle notebook / server.py.

Usage:
    streamlit run dashboard/app.py

**EveFL** — Quantum channel-aware adaptive orchestration for Federated Learning security.

This dashboard is divided into two areas:

### 🔴 LIVE Panels
These compute on-the-fly using the EveFL library:
- **BB84 / QBER Explorer** — Simulate quantum key exchange with configurable Eve attack
- **Security Controller** — See how QBER maps to SECURE / CAUTION / LOCKDOWN
- **Crypto Pipeline** — AES-256-GCM live demo (CKKS & Groth16 are stubs)

### 📊 FL RESULTS Panel
Reads static experiment output only:
- **FL Results** — Visualize `results/fl_training_log.json` without running training

💡 **Tip:** Use the sidebar to navigate between pages.
